/**
 * Represents a relation between two PRM classes A and B (analogous to two relational
 * database tables). The relation is specified by
 * <ol>
 * <li>the class instances A and B.</li>
 * <li>the indices of the fixed attribute in A and B that links the two (typically 
 *     corresponding to a foreign key in A and the primary key of B. <b>At the moment,
 *     B's index cannot be specified; it is and assumed to be its ID field.</b></li>
 * </ol>
 * Furthermore, the relation can be used to cache all 'relation entities', that is, all 
 * references between class entities of the two classes.
 * <p/>
 * Note: the order of A and B matter, since we allow only one-to-one
 * relations and many-to-one relations (and also w.r.t. to the B index assumption above).
 * Many-to-many relations must be resolved using
 * an intermediary PRM class.
