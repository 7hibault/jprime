/**
 * Interface for vertices in an acyclig digraph (DAG) of dependencies.
 * Most commonly, such a graph will consist of state parameters as
 * sources, sub-models corresponding to conditional probabilities as sinks,
 * possibly with cached data structures in between.
 * <p/>
 * The purpose of this interface is mainly to be able to do optimised updates
 * when state parameters have been perturbed or restored.
 * <p/>
 * Let D1,...,Dk be the objects on which this object relies.
 * Typically, methods will be invoked in this order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>D1,...,Dk (or a subset thereof) is about to change: <code>cache()</code>.</li>
 * <li>D1,...,Dk has changed: <code>update()</code>.</li>
 * <li>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>Changes to D1,...,Dk has been accepted: <code>clearCache()</code>.</li>
 *     <li>Changes to D1,...,Dk has been rejected: <code>restoreCache()</code>.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * Additionally, in all calls in a cycle like above, a flag is included specifying if the
 * pending state will be sampled or not, which may be used for special
 * processing if necessary.
