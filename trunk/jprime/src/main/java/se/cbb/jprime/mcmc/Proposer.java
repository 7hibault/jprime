/**
 * Interface for objects perturbing the values of one or more <code>StateParameter</code> objects,
 * e.g. MCMC parameters. This is closely connected to what is sometimes referred to as <i>operators</i> or
 * <i>kernels</i>.
 * Each <code>Proposer</code> is also associated with:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a <code>ProposerWeight</code> which dictates how often it will in
 *     fact be invoked to perform a perturbation (the weight may e.g. change over time).</li>
 * <li>a <code>ProposerStatistics</code> which keeps track of how the often proposed states
 *     have been accepted or rejected (possibly including more detailed info).</li>
 * <li>a set of <code>TuningParameter</code> objects, possibly empty, which typically governs the
 *     "size" of state changes suggested. These parameters may also change over time.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Generally, state parameters are assumed to themselves take care of caching and similarly.
