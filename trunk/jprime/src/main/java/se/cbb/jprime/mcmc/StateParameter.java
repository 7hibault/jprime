/**
 * Interface for state parameters, for instance in an MCMC chain.
 * A state parameter may e.g. be a vector or matrix, in which the individual
 * elements are referred to as "sub-parameters".
 * <p/>
 * A state parameter is a <code>Dependent</code>, albeit typically a source in the DAG.
 * Even though there may be interconnections between
 * parameters (e.g. the times <i>t</i> of a tree <i>S</i>), it is often assumed that these are independent
 * (although a <code>Proposer</code> which changes <i>S</i> usually also perturbs <i>t</i>).
 * <p/>
 * Importantly, a <code>Proposer</code> acting on a state parameter is responsible for
 * caching and possibly restoring its value. However, after a perturbation (but prior to
 * accepting or rejecting the state), the <code>Proposer</code> must invoke <code>setChangeInfo()</code>
 * so that child dependents may know what has happened.
