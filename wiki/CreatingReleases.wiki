= How to create releases of JPrIME =

Naturally, we use Maven for building and packaging. The pom.xml has been set to JAR packaging, and also to use the Maven Shade plugin. This means that on packaging, two kinds of output should be generated in the target directory:
  # An original (small) JPrIME JAR file.
  # An "Ã¼ber" (or "shaded", if you wish) JPrIME JAR file, which contains the small JPrIME JAR file bundled with all dependencies.

In Eclipse, packaging JPrIME should be as easy as to right-click the project root folder and selecting first "Run as -> Maven clean", and then "Run as -> Maven package". Alternatively, from the command prompt, one could instead do {{{mvn clean}}} and then {{{mvn package}}}. This will generate a snapshot build, although manually renaming JAR files and keeping track of version numbers should be sufficient for our needs.

On a side note: a tool for listing all (non-transitive) depencies from the root pom.xml can be found in {{{jprime/src/main/python/getmavendependencies/GetMavenDependencies.py}}}
