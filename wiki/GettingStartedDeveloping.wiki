== Installation instructions ==

Below summary refers to Eclipse. Use of _NetBeans_, etc. should be similar.
The latest verified version is shown within brackets.

  # Download and install _Eclipse_.
  # Download and Install required development tools:
    * Install _Maven_.
    * Possibly install external Subversion (SVN) client if Subversive not sufficient (see below).
  # Install recommended Eclipse plugins:
    * _ Java Development Tools_, if not already in place.
    * _Subversive_ with _SVNKit_ or similarly, which enables SVN handling from within the IDE.
    * _Maven Integration for Eclipse_.
  # Go to the SVN Repository Exploring perspective and add the repository. The location, your username and password can be found under the Source page on the wiki.
  # In the Java perspective, add the project as an existing SVN project. You might have to browse for the trunk.
  # Activate Maven for the project.
  # Start coding! (...possibly under a new branch).

== Good to know ==
  * Make sure that only things that should be kept under version control goes into SVN. Dot directories, target directories, external dependencies, etc. should be added to svn:ignore.
  * Builds and dependencies are handled using Maven. Always add additional dependencies using the pom.xml or similarly. Maven is extremely capable.
  * Logging is not handled with the built-in logger, but rather Logback or log4j (not decided yet).
  * Bug tracking is handled using the Issues page here at Google Code.
  * Application parameter parsing can be achieved in (somewhat) GNU style using JCommander.
  * Unit tests and test suites handled using JUnit. These reside under the src/test/java folder in a package structure which is aligned with that of the source code.
  * When the need for a new root directory seems necessary, try adhering to the _Maven standard directory layout_, as other programs may assume it.
