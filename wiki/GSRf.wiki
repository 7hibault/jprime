#summary Description and instructions for GSRf reconciliation application.

= GSRf =

JPrIME-GSRf is a phylogenetic application for reconciling an unknown guest tree and a known host tree by means of duplication events and loss events. Typically, the guest tree corresponds to a gene tree, and the host tree corresponds to a species tree. JPrIME-GSRf relies on Bayesian inference of model parameters using an MCMC framework. Thus, it will yield a posterior distribution of e.g. guest tree topologies.

Input:
  # a file with a dated host tree.
  # a file with multialignment of guest tree leaf sequences.
  # a file with a simple map relating the guest tree leaves to host tree leaves.

Output:
  # a file with samples drawn from the posterior distribution.
