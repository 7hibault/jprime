#summary Description and instructions for GSRf reconciliation application.

= GSRf =

JPrIME-GSRf is a phylogenetic application for reconciling a guest tree and a host tree by means of duplication events and loss events. Typically, the guest tree corresponds to a gene tree, and the host tree corresponds to a species tree. JPrIME-GSRf relies on Bayesian inference of model parameters using an MCMC framework. Thus, it will yield a posterior distribution of e.g. guest tree topologies.

{{{Input:
  1) a dated host tree
  2) a multialignment of guest tree leaf sequences
  3) a simple map relating the guest tree leaves to host tree leaves
