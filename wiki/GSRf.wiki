#summary Description and instructions for GSRf reconciliation application.

= GSRf =

JPrIME-GSRf is a phylogenetic application for reconciling an unknown guest tree and a known host tree by means of duplication events and loss events. Typically, the guest tree corresponds to a gene tree, and the host tree corresponds to a species tree. JPrIME-GSRf relies on Bayesian inference using an MCMC framework. Thus, it will yield a posterior distribution of guest tree topologies and remaining parameters.

*Input:*
  # a file with a dated host tree.
  # a file with multialignment of guest tree leaf sequences.
  # a file with a simple map relating the guest tree leaves to host tree leaves.

*Output:*
  # a file with samples drawn from the posterior distribution.

== Running ==
 
=== Host tree ===
Obtain a dated species tree in Newick format. The dates may be specified as branch lengths, or as absolute times using special formatting, e.g.

{{{((A:0.4,B:0.4):0.6,C:1.0):0.5;}}}

or analogously

{{{((A[&&PRIME NT=0.0],B[&&PRIME NT=0.0])[&&PRIME NT=0.4],C[&&PRIME NT=0.0])[&&PRIME NT=1.0][&&PRIME TT=0.5];}}}

The host tree must be ultrametric, with time 0 at the leaves and >0 at the root, and a "stem" length >0 (above, this  is set to 0.5). The scale of the dates can be any unit: *they will be rescaled internally s.t. the root time is 1.0 before running, and the output will refer to this*.
