VMCMC is an application for analysing output of MCMC chains. It deals with various metrics for assessing MCMC convergence, as well as summary statistics of inferred real-valued parameters, tree topologies, etc. VMCMC can be used with output from PrIME, and general tab-delimited files such as those produced by JPrIME-DLRS.
