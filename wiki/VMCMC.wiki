= Introduction =

VMCMC is an application for analyzing output of MCMC chains. It deals with various metrics for assessing MCMC convergence, as well as summary statistics of inferred real-valued parameters, tree topologies, etc. VMCMC can be used with output from the C++ version of PrIME, and general tab-delimited files such as those produced by JPrIME some applications (e.g., [DLRS Delirious] and [DLTRS Deleterious]). 

VMCMC supports two modes for analyzing an MCMC chain:
  # Graphical user interface (GUI) for showing trace plots, etc.
  # Command-line summary of important statistics.

= Running =
 
You start the GUI version of VMCMC by running e.g.:
{{{
java -jar VMCMC-x.y.z.jar
}}}
where the details of course refer to your current setup. You can always show all available options by typing e.g.:
{{{
java -jar VMCMC-x.y.z.jar -h
}}}
If you run out of memory when using Oracle's HotSpot Java VM, you can allocate more memory by specifying e.g. (these are not options of VMCMC):
{{{
java -Xms768m -Xmx1536m -jar VMCMC-x.y.z.jar
}}}
To initialize the GUI directly for a specific file, type e.g.:
{{{
java -jar VMCMC-x.y.z.jar myfile.mcmc
}}}
To suppress the GUI and only output summary statistics of the chain in the terminal, type e.g.:
{{{
java -jar VMCMC-x.y.z.jar myfile.mcmc -n
}}}
