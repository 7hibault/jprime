 * Interface for 1-D continuous probability distributions, i.e. acting on real numbers.

 * <p/>
 * "Continuous" is here used in the sense distinguishing it from discrete distributions.
 * It is thus perfectly allowed to have an implementation which is piecewise continuous, e.g.
 * resembling a histogram. We do, however, require that all implementations are defined
 * for a single domain [a,b], (a,b], [a,b) or (a,b), where the boundaries a&lt;b may take on
 * real numbers as well as negative and positive infinity.
