/**
 * Interface for proper dependents, i.e. objects which ultimately rely on
 * state parameters.
 * <p/>
 * Let D1,...,Dk be the objects on which this object relies and which have changed.
 * Typically, methods will be invoked in this order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>D1,...,Dk have changed: <code>this.cacheAndUpdateAndSetChangeInfo()</code>. Internally, this typically
 *     means:
 *     <ol>
 *         <li>Querying {D1,...,Dk}<code>.getChangeInfo()</code> for info.</li>
 *         <li>Caching relevant parts.</li>
 *         <li>Updating relevant parts.</li>
 *         <li>Setting this object's own change info.</li>
 *     </ol>
 * <li>After all state changes:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>State has been accepted: <code>this.clearCacheAndClearChangeInfo()</code>.</li>
 *     <li>State has been rejected: <code>this.restoreCacheAndClearChangeInfo()</code>.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * In all calls in a cycle like above, a flag is included specifying if the
 * pending state will be sampled or not, which may be used for special
 * processing if necessary.
