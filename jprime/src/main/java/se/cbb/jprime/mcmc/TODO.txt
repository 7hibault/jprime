To do (not only w.r.t. mcmc package):

- Finish implementing Probability.
- Write unit tests for Probability.
- If necessary, create wrapper around MersenneTwister for supporting
  seed tracking and XML serialisation.
- Implement single-object selecting ProposerSelector.
- Implement MCMCManager.


To remember:

- When selecting multiple proposers, one must make sure the same state parameter is
 not affected multiple times, or else the Q(x;x')/Q(x';x) ratio will be incorrect.
