/**
 * Interface for vertices in an acyclig digraph (DAG) of model dependencies.
 * Most commonly, such a graph will consist of state parameters as
 * sources, sub-models corresponding to conditional probabilities as sinks,
 * possibly with cached data structures in between.
 * Note: The DAG will induce the Bayesian hierarchy of the sub-models, but, as
 * mentioned, allows for additional intermediary data structures.
 * <p/>
 * The purpose of this interface is mainly to be able to do optimised updates
 * when state parameters have been perturbed or restored.
 * <p/>
 * Let D1,...,Dk be the objects on which this object relies (or a subset thereof).
 * Typically, methods will be invoked in this order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>D1,...,Dk are about to change: <code>this.cache()</code>.</li>
 * <li>D1,...,Dk has finished updating: <code>this.update()</code>. When doing this,
 *     the child should be able to query its parents for updates through
 *     <code>di.getChangeInfo()</code>.</li>
 * <li>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li>Changes have been accepted: <code>this.clearCache()</code>.</li>
 *     <li>Changes have been rejected: <code>this.restoreCache()</code>.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * In all calls in a cycle like above, a flag is included specifying if the
 * pending state will be sampled or not, which may be used for special
 * processing if necessary. See also interface <code>StateParameter</code>.
