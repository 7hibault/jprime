/**
 * Interface for probabilistic models. Subject to change,
 * and very spartan at the moment.
 * <p/>
 * A model is a <code>Dependent</code>, and as such typically a sink
 * in a dependency DAG where the state parameters are sources.
 * It should ideally compute its likelihood when <code>update()</code>
 * is invoked, and only return this value when <code>getLikelihood()</code> is
 * called. Also, it should be able to cache and restore its old values if proposed
 * state rejected.
 * <p/>
 * Furthermore, a model can act as a "sampleable". No particular requirements are made as to
 * what is sampled, although outputting the model's log-likelihood is recommended.
